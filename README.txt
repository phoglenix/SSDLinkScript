A small script to make it easy to create symlinks to files in another directory on Windows.
I use it to link to all of my steam files on my HDD so I can just put the few I use frequently
 on my SSD.

Use:
Make sure to check and correctly set the paths on lines 3 and 4 of the file!
Run as administrator.


I take zero responsibility if this deletes your files, destroys your computer, burns your house
 down, or angers your cat.
It shouldn't, but use at your own risk!
